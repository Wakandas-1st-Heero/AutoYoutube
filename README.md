# AutoYoutube

Hey Stranger,

This project or code was designed to take a youtube video and add it to anchor (podcast platform) My code is very how do say... epic (I have to laugh to stop myself from crying)
but I am proud of it and you are more than welcome to try it out and see if it works for you. 
hmu on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/codingwithstrangers if you have any questions 

Thanks 
with Love 
Heero 

PS Machinegun did all the work I just make people laugh in chat
